## Lab 1: Back-Propagation
    
     In this Lab, students are required to understand and implement simple neural networks 
     with forwarding pass and backpropagation using two hidden layers. Furthermore, I 
     implemented all the extra parts for your reference.

## Lab 2: EEG Classification
    
     In this lab, students are required to implement EEGNet and DeepConvNet with different 
     activation functions (ReLU, Leaky ReLU and ELU) to classify BCI competition dataset. 
     The experiment result can achieve 88%-89% accuracy.

## Lab 3: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
    
     In this lab, students are required to implement ResNet18/ResNet50 to analysis diabetic 
     retinopathy (糖尿病所引發視網膜病變). Also students need to implement custom DataLoader 
     through PyTorch framework and calculate the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance. 
     The experiment result can achieve 82% accuracy.

## Lab 4: Conditional VAE For Video Prediction
    
     In this lab, students are required to implement a conditional VAE for video prediction. 
     Also students need to implement KL cost annealing, teacher forcing, dataloader, etc. 
     The experiment result in cyclical can achieve 26.6 PSNR. Furthermore, I implemented prior 
     extra part for your reference.

## Lab 5: Let’s Play GANs
    
     In this lab, students are required to implement a conditional GAN to generate synthetic
     images according to multi-label conditions. For example, given “red cube” and “blue cylinder”, 
     model should generate the synthetic images with red cube and blue cylinder. Meanwhile, generated 
     images would be feed into a pre-trained classifier for evaluation. The experiment results can 
     achieve 84.7% accuracy on test.json and 91.7% accuracy on new_test.json.

## Lab 6: Deep Q-Network and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
    
     In this lab, students will learn and implement two deep reinforcement algorithms by 
     completing the following two tasks: (1) solve LunarLander-v2 using DQN, and (2) solve 
     LunarLanderContinuous-v2 using DDPG. The experiment results can achieve 305 average 
     reward on LunarLander-v2 by DQN, and 308 average reward on LunarLanderContinuous-v2 by 
     TD3. Furthermore, I implemented all the extra parts for your reference.
