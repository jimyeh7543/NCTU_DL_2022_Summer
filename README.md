## Lab 1: Back-Propagation
    
     In this Lab, students are required to understand and implement simple neural networks 
     with forwarding pass and backpropagation using two hidden layers. Furthermore, I 
     implemented all the extra parts for your reference.

## Lab 2: EEG Classification
    
     In this lab, students are required to implement EEGNet and DeepConvNet with different 
     activation functions (ReLU, Leaky ReLU and ELU) to classify BCI competition dataset. 
     The experiment result can achieve 88%-89% accuracy.

## Lab 3: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection
    
     In this lab, students are required to implement ResNet18/ResNet50 to analysis diabetic 
     retinopathy (糖尿病所引發視網膜病變). Also students need to implement custom DataLoader 
     through PyTorch framework and calculate the confusion matrix to evaluate the performance. 
     The experiment result can achieve 82% accuracy.

## Lab 4: Conditional VAE For Video Prediction
    
     In this lab, students are required to implement a conditional VAE for video prediction. 
     Also students need to implement KL cost annealing, teacher forcing, dataloader, etc. 
     The experiment result in cyclical can achieve 26.6 PSNR. Furthermore, I implemented prior 
     extra part for your reference.
