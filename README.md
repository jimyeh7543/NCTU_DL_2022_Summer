## Lab 1: Back-Propagation
    
     In this Lab, students are required to understand and implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and 
     backpropagation using two hidden layers. Furthermore, I have implemented all the extra part for your reference.

## Lab 2: EEG classification
    
     In this lab, students are required to implement EEGNet and DeepConvNet with three kinds of activation function: 
     ReLU, Leaky ReLU and ELU to classify BCI competition dataset. The experiment result can achieve 88%-89% accuracy.
